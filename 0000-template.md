## 0. Abstract

> A brief introductory explanation or abstract of the publication.

## 1. Status

> The status of this document should be reflected here.

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

> An introduction into the features, protocols, structures, or systems described
> throughout this document.

## 3. Background & Motivation

> An explanation of the background and motivation for content described
> throughout the document. This section should detail use cases
> and expected outcomes.

## 4. <Topic Name>

> This section should detail any terminology used through the rest of
> this section or document that may be foreign, conflated, or confused by the
> the reader.

> This section is intended to explain the design features, protocols,
> structures, or systems described by this document. This section should
> be verbose, intuitive, contain necessary citations, provide code blocks, and
> contain enough information for implementation or integration.

## 5. Real World Example

> This section should present a real world example showing expected
> outcomes described by the content of this document.

> If an RFC describes a data structure, a human readable visual representation
> should be shown, such as a JSON structure.

> If an RFC describes a system or protocol, visuals showing interactions
> between entities described therein should be present along with
> ancillary data structures.

> If an RFC describes a functional API for a programming language, it
> should detail the signatures, usage, and combinations with other
> functions described in this document.

> This section is intended to be intuitive and present a real world case
> for the content described in this document.

## 6. Drawbacks

> This section should describe known drawbacks for implementers
> wishing to implement or integrate features, protocols, structures, or systems
> described by this document. A reader should be able to read this section
> and understand why, if there is a reason, they should *not* implement
> or integrate features, protocols, structures, or systems described by
> this document.

## 7. Alternatives

> This section should describe alternatives to the features, protocols,
> structures, or systems detailed in this document. If a RFC describes
> a key exchange protocol, then it should also detail the alternatives
> such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

## 8. Adoption Strategy

> This section should describe necessary details for the implementation,
> integration, or adoption of the content described by this section.

## 9. Unresolved Questions

> This section should provide and attempt to resolve any lingering questions
> regarding the contents of this document.

## 10 Security Considerations

> This section should describe all security considerations related to
> the implementation or integration of the features, protocols, structures,
> or systems described by this document.

## 11. References

> Reference citation should be indexed and detailed in this section.
