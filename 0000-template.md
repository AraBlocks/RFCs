# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example

If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation

* Why are we doing this? 
* What use cases does it support? 
* What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with Ara to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives

* What other designs have been considered? 
* What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing developers adopt it? Is
this a breaking change?

# Unresolved questions

Are there any lingering questions that need to be answered prior to a possible implementation of this RFC?
