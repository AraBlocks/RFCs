## 0. Abstract

Ara Farming Protocol (AFP) provides methods for distributed decentralized services in the Ara Network to request work from its peers and determine the specifications of work contracts (i.e. rewards and other service-specific details).

## 1. Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

AFP defines a set of extensible classes in Javascript which enable peers of a distributed service to communicate about and define a [statement-of-work](#416-statement-of-work) for that service. Peers exchange messages in the form of [farming-protocol-buffers](https://github.com/AraBlocks/farming-protocol-buffers).

AFP also provides a default implementation for communicating over duplex streams.

A [farmer](#412-farmer) would extend the AFP Farmer class to define that farmer’s specifications for generating a [quote](#419-quote) for a task, validating a peer/[SOW](#416-statement-of-work) for a task, and signing and validating an [agreement](#4110-agreement) for a task. The farmer could then use a discovery-swarm (or some other peer discovery method) to broadcast their ability to complete a task, and then communicate via a duplex stream their capabilities and costs.

A [requester](#413-requester) would extend the AFP Requester class to define the requester's specifications for validating peers/quotes for a task, creating and validating agreements for a task, and for starting a task. A requester would also extend the AFP Matcher class to define the specifications for selecting and hiring a set of peers given their quotes for a task. The requester could then use a discovery-swarm to connect to peers and use AFP to discuss the task.

The default interaction between a requester and a farmer is the following:

1. Requester sends SOW to farmer
2. Farmer validates SOW and replies with quote for work
3. Requester validates quote and selects set of peers to complete work based on quotes
4. Requester sends agreement to selected farmers
5. Farmer validates agreement and countersigns agreement
6. Requester validates agreement and distributes work
7. If rewardable, when work is finished, requester sends reward to farmer
8. Farmer validates reward and returns a receipt to requester

## 3. Background & Motivation

In the current market, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are oftentimes treated more as an investment than a currency. Although these digital assets are high in value, the lack of spending opportunities prevents them from being regularly exchanged for goods and services [[1]](#11-references). 

In distributed services ecosystems, such as torrents, there is oftentimes the issue that there are more leechers (those who take from but do not contribute to a system) than there are seeders (those who support the system through being available to upload files) [[2]](#11-references). This is often attributed to the notion that there is no incentive to seed the network, since once you have the file, you likely do not gain from hosting it [[3]](#11-references).

Ara Farming Protocol enables developers to provide incentives for users to participate in distributed services. Rewarding distributed services facilitates the circulation of tokens and gives a reason for peers to participate in the network. Instead of “mining”, which is generally associated with a task that does not inherently benefit the system, a user can earn tokens through “farming”, or participating in the service. AFP also helps instill trust in the work system by tying services to Ethereum smart contracts, in order to show full transparency when agreeing upon work.

## 4. Ara Farming

This section outlines terminology used throughout this document, as well expected methodologies needed for the protocol.

### 4.1. Terminology

#### 4.1.1. Farming

Performing a service for another peer in the network, potentially for a reward.

#### 4.1.2. Farmer

A peer in the network who can provide a service.

#### 4.1.3. Requester

A peer in the network who desires to distribute work amongst peers.

#### 4.1.4. AraId

The Ara Identity associated with a peer.

```proto
message AraId {
  string did = 1;
}
```

#### 4.1.5. Signature

A signed piece of data that can be used to validate a peer.

```proto
message Signature {
  AraId ara_id = 1;
  bytes data = 2;
}
```

#### 4.1.6. Statement-of-Work

The scope of a distributable task, i.e. units-of-work, minimum resources, delivery date, etc. Also referred to as SOW.

```proto
message SOW {
  bytes nonce = 1;
  string work_unit = 2;
  AraId requester = 3;
  bytes data = 4;
}
```

#### 4.1.7. Unit-of-Work

A service-defined amount of work used to discuss and normalize rewards, e.g. GB for file transfers, or a frame for transcoding.

#### 4.1.8. Proof-of-Work

A method used to prove that a farmer participating in a task has successfully completed a certain amount of the task.

#### 4.1.9. Quote

A farmer's response to a SOW, including cost per unit-of-work for the given SOW. 

```proto
message Quote {
  bytes nonce = 1;
  int64 per_unit_cost = 2;
  SOW sow = 3;
  AraId farmer = 4;
}
```

#### 4.1.10. Agreement

An agreed upon statement-of-work and quote between a farmer and a requester. This may reference a specific smart contract, or some other verifiable source, which can validate the details of an agreement.

```proto
message Agreement {
  bytes nonce = 1;
  Quote quote = 2;
  Signature requester_signature = 3;
  Signature farmer_signature = 4;
  bytes data = 5;
}
```

#### 4.1.11. Reward

A reward for a specific agreement, sent by a verifiable peer.

```proto
message Reward {
  bytes nonce = 1;
  Agreement agreement = 2;
  int64 amount = 3;
  Signature requester_signature = 4;
  bytes data = 5;
}
```

#### 4.1.12. Receipt

A receipt for a reward, sent by a verifiable peer.

```proto
message Receipt {
  bytes nonce = 1;
  Reward reward = 2;
  Signature farmer_signature = 3;
}
```

### 4.2. Interfaces

In order to provide flexibility, this section describes interfaces that must be implemented on a per-service basis.

#### 4.2.1. Requester

A requester must extend the Requester class to define the requester's specifications for validating quotes for a task, creating and validating agreements for a task, and for starting a task.

```js
/**
 * Returns whether a quote is valid.
 * @param {messages.Quote} quote
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
async validateQuote(quote) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement validateQuote.')
}

/**
 * Generate and return an agreement for a quote.
 * @param {messages.Quote} quote
 * @returns {messages.Agreement}
 */
async generateAgreement(quote) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement generateAgreement.')
}

/**
 * Return whether an agreement is valid.
 * @param {messages.Agreement} agreement
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
async validateAgreement(agreement) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement validateAgreement.')
}

/**
 * Called when an agreement has been marked as valid and a farmer
 * is ready to start work.
 * @param {messages.Agreement} agreement
 * @param {PeerConnection} connection
 */
async onHireConfirmed(agreement, connection) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement onHireConfirmed')
}

/**
 * On receipt of a reward receipt from a farmer.
 * @param {messages.Receipt} receipt
 * @param {PeerConnection} connection
 */
async onReceipt(receipt, connection) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement onReceipt')
}
```

#### 4.2.2. Farmer

A farmer must extend the Farmer class to define that farmer’s specifications for generating a quote for a task, validating a SOW for a task, and signing and validating an agreement for a task. If rewards are expected, then a farmer would also handle validating the reward and generating a receipt.

```js
/**
 * Return whether a sow is valid.
 * @param {messages.SOW} sow
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
async validateSow(sow) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement validateSow.')
}

/**
 * Return whether a reward is valid.
 * @param {messages.Reward} reward
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
async validateReward(reward) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement validateReward.')
}

/**
 * Return whether an agreement is valid.
 * @param {messages.Agreement} agreement
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
async validateAgreement(agreement) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement validateAgreement.')
}

/**
 * Return a receipt given a reward.
 * @param {messages.Reward} reward
 * @returns {messages.Receipt}
 */
async generateReceipt(reward) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement generateReceipt.')
}

/**
 * Return a quote given a sow.
 * @param {messages.SOW} sow
 * @returns {messages.Quote}
 */
async generateQuote(sow) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement generateQuote.')
}

/**
 * Sign and return an agreement.
 * @param {messages.Agreement} agreement
 * @returns {messages.Agreement}
 */
async signAgreement(agreement) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement signAgreement.')
}
```

#### 4.2.3. Matcher

Different service requesters may have different needs when selecting peers, such as selecting the cheapest set, the fastest set, the first set number of peers, etc. To allow for this, each service may implement their own matcher (or use one of a set of predefined matchers) that extends the Matcher class. This class describes an object that, given a set of options, selects a subset of peers using a matching strategy specific to the service.

```js
/**
 * Add a quote for consideration. If a quote is considered
 * valid, then call hireFarmerCallback to continue
 * agreement process.
 * @param {messages.Quote} quote
 * @param {function(messages.Agreement)} hireFarmerCallback
 */
async addQuote(quote, hireFarmerCallback) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement addQuote')
}

/**
 * Remove quote from consideration.
 * @param {messages.Quote} quote
 */
async removeQuote(quote) {
  throw new Error('Extended classes must implement removeQuote')
}
```

## 5. Real World Example

Example implementations can be found [here](https://github.com/littlstar/farming-protocol/tree/master/examples).

### 5.1. A Decentralized Content Distribution Service

In the case of content distribution, a content requester is looking for a set of peers that have a specific piece of content, i.e. `movie.mp4`, who are willing to transfer that content to the requester. The requester is willing to reward a certain amount per GB, i.e. 5 Ara/GB, for the file transfer.

The content requester would first find a set of farmers that have the desired content. The requester would then pass those farmers to their implementation of AFP. AFP would then ask each peer their transfer cost per GB of data. If the cost is less than or equal the maximum amount the requester is willing to pay, then the requester would employ the farmer. The AFP implementation could then take subset of farmers who have contractually agreed to do work for the requester and start file transfer.

### 5.2. A Video Transcoding Service

In the case of video transcoding, a requester is looking for a set of peers that are able to transcode a video, i.e. `my_movie.mp4`. The requester is willing to reward a certain amount per frame, i.e 5 Ara/Frame, that is transcoded.

The requester would first find a set of farmers who have the correct software for transcoding the video. The requester would then pass those farmers to their AFP implementation. AFP would then ask each peer their transcode cost per frame. The matcher implementation could then find a set of peers whose total cost is less than a desired amount and then hire that set of farmers. The AFP implementation could then take subset of farmers who have contractually agreed to do work for the requester and start the video transcode.

## 6. Drawbacks

There are many methods for determining cost in an open market, so any limitation on how cost is determined may result in a direct or indirect impact on the market itself. In this RFC, on a per-contract basis, the requester asks for a single non-updateable bid for a statement-of-work from each farmer. This gives an advantage to the requester because it allows them to choose a lower cost farmer (even if the requester was initially willing to pay more). It also does not allow the farmer to adjust their bid in real-time for the current contract, nor does it allow the farmer to compare their bid with the bids of other farmers for the current contract. The farmer, however, can adjust their bid prior to the next work request, and through AFP, can check to see the cost of nearby peers to stay competitive. This means that this cost determination method should have no significant impact on the larger market. 

## 7. Alternatives

An alternative to a single bid system would be to have a third party be the moderator of a bid, such as is used in real-time bidding with advertising. 

Another alternative would be to have a public marketplace where farmers and requesters list their service requests/offers, and use this marketplace to find workers/work.

## 8. Adoption Strategy

Ara Farming Protocol is hosted on Github, under AraBlocks organization, and distributed as an open source project along with other Ara core components. AFP is not a required component for using Ara, but it is currently being extended with DCDN to allow for rewardable file distribution. 

## 9. Unresolved Questions

### 9.1. How would contracts without defined ends (such as file storage) use AFP?

These sort of contracts could be set to deliver rewards in discretized intervals (such as a monthly basis). The service could be setup to renegotiate contracts at these intervals based on current market costs. Guaranteeing uninterrupted service would be the responsibility of the developer of the service. 

### 9.2. How would AFP deter farmers/requesters from gaming the system?

If it is possible for farmers to request the bids of other farmers through AFP, then it is possible that farmers could simply underbid their neighbors to guarantee that they receive the work. While this is possible, it is really a question of the market (scarcity of work vs. scarcity of farmers) if this will actually be a problem.  

## 10 Security Considerations

Each specific implementation will have its own security considerations, i.e. is the communication encrypted, how can the peer be trusted, and how can the data received be trusted. By using AFP in coordination with the Ara ecosystem, some of these concerns can be addressed.
