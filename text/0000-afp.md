## 0. Abstract

ARA Farming Protocol (AFP) provides methods for distributed decentralized services, or decents, in the ARA Network to request work from its peers and determine the specifications of work contracts (i.e. pricing and other service-specific details).

## 1. Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

AFP defines a set of methods in javascript and objects in proto which enable peers of a distributed service to communicate about and define a statement of work for that service. 

For a Farmer, AFP would be used to define that Farmer’s minimum accepted price for providing a service, as well as other parameters more specific to the service. If a Requester wishes to hire a Farmer, AFP would handle signing a contract of work and sending a start signal for beginning a job.

For a Requester, AFP would be used to define the maximum price the Requester is willing to pay for a service, the preferred number of Farmers for a job, and other parameters specific to the service. AFP would also take in a matching method used to determine the peers. Once a set of peers is determined through the matching method, AFP would handle initiating and signing a contract of work, and sending a start signal to begin the distribution of work.

## 3. Background & Motivation

In the current market, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are oftentimes treated more as an investment than a currency. Although these digital assets are high in value, the lack of spending opportunities prevents them from being regularly exchanged for goods and services [1]. 

In distributed services ecosystems, such as torrents, there is oftentimes the issue that there are more leechers (those who take from but do not contribute to a system) than there are seeders (those who support the system through being available to upload files) [2]. This is often attributed to the notion that there is no incentive to seed the network, since once you have the file, you likely do not gain from hosting it [3].

ARA Farming Protocol enables services to provide incentives for users to participate in said distributed services. This helps enable the circulation of tokens through spending on services and gives a reason for peers to participate in the network. Instead of “mining”, which is generally associated with a task that does not inherently benefit the system, a user can earn tokens through “farming”, or participating in the service. AFP also helps instill trust in the work system by tying services to Ethereum smart contracts, in order to show full transparency when agreeing upon work.

## 4. ARA Farming

This section outlines terminology used throughout this document, as well expected methodologies needed for the protocol.

### 4.1. Terminology

#### 4.1.1. Farming

Performing a service for another peer in the network for a reward.

### 4.1.2. Farmer

A peer in the network who participates in Farming.

### 4.1.3. Requester

A peer in the network who initiated a request for Farmers.

### 4.1.4. Statement of Work

A set of parameters/options which define a set of work to be rewarded by a specified contract.

### 4.1.5. Contract

An ethereum smart contract used to verify that each party (the requester and the farmer) have agreed and staked tokens for completing work, and used to distribute rewards.

### 4.1.6. Unit of Work

A service-defined amount of work used to discuss price and normalize rewards. 

### 4.1.7. Proof of Work
A method used to prove that a Farmer participating in a task has successfully completed a certain amount of the task.

### 4.2 Interfaces
In order to provide flexibility, this section describes interfaces that can be implemented on a per-service basis.

#### 4.2.. Matcher
Different services may have different needs when selecting peers, such as selecting the cheapest set, the fastest set, the first set number of peers, etc.  To allow for this, each service may implement their own matcher (or use one of a set of predefined matchers) that follows the Matcher interface. This interface describes an object that, given a set of options, downselects a group of peers using a matching strategy specific to the service. 

#### 4.2.. Authenticator
Different services may have different needs when authenticating peers. To allow for this, each service may implement their own authenticator that follows the Authenticator interface. This interface describes an object that, given a set of options, validates that a peer has the rights/authority to request/fulfill a job.

### 4.3. Methods

#### 4.3.1. getCost(options)
Requester calls this to get cost of farmer

#### 4.3.2. setCost(options)
Farmer calls this to define their own cost

#### 4.3.3. requestWork(options)
Requester calls this to request work from farmer

#### 4.3.4. initializeContract(options)
Requester calls this to initialize a contract for a specific task.

#### 4.3.5. addFarmerToContract(options)
Requester calls this to add a farmer to a specific contract

#### 4.3.6. hireFarmer(options)
Requester calls this to send farmer the signed contract. Expects a counter-signed contract in return.

#### 4.3.7. submitWork(options)
Farmer calls this to submit work after they has finished their task

## 5. Real World Example

### 5.1. A Decentralized Content Distribution Service

In the case of content distribution, the content requester would first find a set of farmers that have the specific content. The requester would then pass those farmers to AFP. AFP would then ask each peer their cost per unit-of-work (for example, the cost the farmer requires to deliver a GB of data). If the cost is less than or equal to the requester’s maximum amount they are willing to pay, then the requester will employ the farmer. 

## 6. Drawbacks

There are many methods for determining pricing in an open market, so any limitation on how pricing is determined may result in a direct or indirect impact on the market itself. In this RFC, the requester asks for a single non-updateable bid for a job from each farmer. This gives an advantage to the requester on initial bidding because it allows them to choose a lower price farmer (even if the requester was initially willing to pay more). It also does not allow the farmer to adjust their bid in real-time, nor does it allow the farmer to compare their bid with the bids of other farmers. The farmer, however, can adjust their bid during the next job process, and through AFP, can check to see the pricing of nearby peers. This means there will be no real difference in the larger market. 

## 7. Alternatives

An alternative to a single bid system would be to have a third party be the moderator of a bid, such as is used in real-time bidding with advertising. 

Another alternative would be to have a public marketplace where farmers and requesters list their jobs/offers, and use this job board to find workers/work.

## 8. Adoption Strategy

ARA Farming Protocol is hosted on Github, under AraBlocks organization, and distributed as an open source project along with other ARA core components. AFP is not a required component for using ARA, but is used for AFS and DCDN.
