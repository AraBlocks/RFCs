## 0. Abstract

ARA Farming Protocol (AFP) provides methods for distributed decentralized services, or decents, in the ARA Network to request work from its peers and determine the specifications of work contracts (i.e. rewards and other service-specific details).

## 1. Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

AFP defines a set of methods in Javascript and objects in Proto which enable peers of a distributed service to communicate about and define a statement of work for that service. AFP also provides a default implementation using gRPC servers/clients in Javascript.

For a [farmer](#412-farmer), AFP would be used to define that farmer’s minimum accepted rewards for providing a service, as well as other parameters more specific to the service. If a requester wishes to hire a farmer, AFP would handle signing a contract of work and sending a start signal for beginning the work.

For a [requester](#413-requester), AFP would be used to define the maximum reward the requester is willing to give for a service, the number of farmers required, and other parameters specific to the service. AFP would also take in a [matcher](#421-matcher) used to determine the peers. Once a set of peers is determined through the matcher, AFP would handle initiating and signing a contract of work, and sending a start signal to begin the distribution of work.

## 3. Background & Motivation

In the current market, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are oftentimes treated more as an investment than a currency. Although these digital assets are high in value, the lack of spending opportunities prevents them from being regularly exchanged for goods and services [[1]](#11-references). 

In distributed services ecosystems, such as torrents, there is oftentimes the issue that there are more leechers (those who take from but do not contribute to a system) than there are seeders (those who support the system through being available to upload files) [[2]](#11-references). This is often attributed to the notion that there is no incentive to seed the network, since once you have the file, you likely do not gain from hosting it [[3]](#11-references).

ARA Farming Protocol enables developers to provide incentives for users to participate in distributed services. Rewarding distributed services facilitates the circulation of tokens and gives a reason for peers to participate in the network. Instead of “mining”, which is generally associated with a task that does not inherently benefit the system, a user can earn tokens through “farming”, or participating in the service. AFP also helps instill trust in the work system by tying services to Ethereum smart contracts, in order to show full transparency when agreeing upon work.

## 4. ARA Farming

This section outlines terminology used throughout this document, as well expected methodologies needed for the protocol.

### 4.1. Terminology

#### 4.1.1. Farming

Performing a service for another peer in the network for a reward.

#### 4.1.2. Farmer

A peer in the network who participates in farming.

```proto

```

#### 4.1.3. Requester

A peer in the network who initiated a request for farmers.

```proto

```

#### 4.1.4. Statement of Work

A set of parameters/options which define a set of work to be rewarded by a specified contract.

```proto
message SOW {
  required int32 id = 1;
  required string workUnit = 2;
}
```

#### 4.1.5. Contract

An Ethereum smart contract used to distribute rewards and to verify that each party (the requester and the farmer) has agreed on and staked tokens for completing work.

```proto
message Contract {
  required int64 id = 1;
  required RequesterSignature requester = 2;
  required FarmerSignature farmer = 3;
}
```

The id here can either refer to the address of the smart contract, or some hash that identifies the unique contract for a defined statement of work.

#### 4.1.6. Unit of Work

A service-defined amount of work used to discuss and normalize rewards. 

#### 4.1.7. Proof of Work

A method used to prove that a farmer participating in a task has successfully completed a certain amount of the task.

#### 4.1.8. Quote

The rewards required to complete a unit of work.

```proto
message Quote {
  required int32 cost = 1;
  required SOW sow = 2;
}
```

#### 4.1.9 Signatures

Verifiable signatures on a contract from each party to confer that an agreement has been reached.

```proto
message RequesterSignature {
  required int64 id = 1;
}

message FarmerSignature {
  required int64 id = 1;
}
```

### 4.2 Interfaces

In order to provide flexibility, this section describes interfaces that can be implemented on a per-service basis.

#### 4.2.1. Matcher

Different services may have different needs when selecting peers, such as selecting the cheapest set, the fastest set, the first set number of peers, etc.  To allow for this, each service may implement their own matcher (or use one of a set of predefined matchers) that follows the Matcher interface. This interface describes an object that, given a set of options, selects a subset of peers using a matching strategy specific to the service. 

```js
class Matcher {
    constructor(){
        this.workers = 0;
    }

    considerQuoteOption(quote, hireFarmerCallback){
        if (quote.cost < 10 && this.workers < 7) {
            hireFarmerCallback();
            this.workers++;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.2.2. Authenticator

Different services may have different needs when authenticating peers. To allow for this, each service may implement their own authenticator (or use one of a set of predefined authenticators) that follows the Authenticator interface. This interface describes an object that, given a set of options, validates that a peer has the rights/authority to request/fulfill a statement of work.

### 4.3. Methods

#### 4.3.1 External

These methods are intended to aid in the exchange of information between a requester and a farmer.

##### 4.3.1.1. getQuote(SOW)

Returns the quote of a farmer given a statement of work.

```proto
  rpc GetQuote(SOW) returns(Quote);
```

##### 4.3.1.2. finalizeProposal(SOW)

Returns the farmer's interest in working given a statement of work. If interested, expects the Farmer's ARAid.

```proto
  rpc FinalizeProposal(SOW) returns(ARAid);
```

##### 4.3.1.3 awardContract(Contract)

Sends farmer a reference to a signed contract. Expects a counter-signed contract in return.

```proto
  rpc AwardContract(Contract) returns(Contract);
```

#### 4.3.2 Internal Requester

These methods are intended for aiding a Requester.

##### 4.3.2.1 connectToFarmer(options)

Connects to a Farmer Server for communicating.

#### 4.3.3. Internal Farmer

##### 4.3.3.1. broadcastFarmer(options)

Creates a Farmer Server (using gRPC) and broadcasts its availablity to work as a function of a set of options.

## 5. Real World Example

### 5.1. A Decentralized Content Distribution Service

In the case of content distribution, the content requester would first find a set of farmers that have the specific content. The requester would then pass those farmers to AFP. AFP would then ask each peer their cost per unit-of-work (for example, the cost the farmer requires to deliver a GB of data). If the cost is less than or equal to the requester’s maximum amount they are willing to pay, then the requester will employ the farmer. 

The following example generates and connects 50 farmers, then hires up to 7 farmers that charge less than 10 ARA per MB.

```js
const { broadcastFarmer, connectToFarmer } = require('./farmer');
const { Requester } = require('./requester');
const { Matcher } = require('./matcher');

class ExampleMatcher extends Matcher {
    constructor(maxCost, maxWorkers){
        super();
        this.maxCost = maxCost;
        this.maxWorkers = maxWorkers;
        this.workers = 0;
    }

    considerQuoteOption(quote, hireFarmerCallback){
        if (quote.cost < this.maxCost && this.workers < this.maxWorkers) {
            hireFarmerCallback();
            this.workers++;
        }
    }
}

/*
    Generates and connects to a number of Farmer Servers
*/
function generateFarmerConnections(count){
    let sPort = 50051;

    let farmers = [];
    for (i = 0; i < count; i++){
        let port = 'localhost:' + (sPort + i).toString();
        let price = 5 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
        
        // Generate Servers
        broadcastFarmer(port, price, i);

        // Generate Client Connections
        let connection = connectToFarmer(port);
        farmers.push(connection);
    }
    return farmers;
}

/* 
    Example: generate and connect to 50 farmers, then hire up to 
    7 farmers who charge <= 10 Ara per MB
*/
let sow = {
    id: 2,
    workUnit: "MB"
}
let farmers = generateFarmerConnections(50);
let matcher = new ExampleMatcher(10, 7);
let requester = new Requester(sow, matcher);
requester.processFarmers(farmers);
```

## 6. Drawbacks

There are many methods for determining cost in an open market, so any limitation on how cost is determined may result in a direct or indirect impact on the market itself. In this RFC, on a per-contract basis, the requester asks for a single non-updateable bid for a statement-of-work from each farmer. This gives an advantage to the requester because it allows them to choose a lower cost farmer (even if the requester was initially willing to pay more). It also does not allow the farmer to adjust their bid in real-time for the current contract, nor does it allow the farmer to compare their bid with the bids of other farmers for the current contract. The farmer, however, can adjust their bid prior to the next work request, and through AFP, can check to see the cost of nearby peers to stay competitive. This means that this cost determination method should have no significant impact on the larger market. 

## 7. Alternatives

An alternative to a single bid system would be to have a third party be the moderator of a bid, such as is used in real-time bidding with advertising. 

Another alternative would be to have a public marketplace where farmers and requesters list their service requests/offers, and use this marketplace to find workers/work.

## 8. Adoption Strategy

ARA Farming Protocol is hosted on Github, under AraBlocks organization, and distributed as an open source project along with other ARA core components. AFP is not a required component for using ARA, but is used for AFS and DCDN.

## 9. Unresolved Questions

### 9.1. How would contracts without defined ends (such as file storage) use AFP?

These sort of contracts could be set to deliver rewards in discretized intervals (such as a monthly basis). The service could be setup to renegotiate contracts at these intervals based on current market costs. Guaranteeing uninterrupted service would be the responsibility of the developer of the service. 

### 9.2. How would AFP deter farmers/requesters from gaming the system?

If it is possible for farmers to request the bids of other farmers through AFP, then it is possible that farmers could simply underbid their neighbors to guarantee that they receive the work. While this is possible, it is really a question of the market (scarcity of work vs. scarcity of farmers) if this will actually be problem.
