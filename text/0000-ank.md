## 0. Abstract

_**ARA Network Keys**_ describes an asymmetric secret storage for
network authentication, integrity, capability, and discovery protocols.

## 1.Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

_**ARA Network Keys**_ are an asymmetric secret storage [1] for storing
public and secret network keys used for peer discovery, authentication, and
capability [2] based handshakes. Alice (client) can authenticate and express
capability to Bob (remote) through a _key-hashed message authentication code_
(HMAC) [9] over a domain using network keys she received from Bob.

Network keys come in _public_ and _secret_ forms.

_**Public**_ network keys are offered publicly by Bob accompanied with a
_shared secret key_ [8] that encrypts a _discovery key_, _domain key_,
and _public key_.

_**Secret**_ network keys can only be decrypted by the party who generated
them as they are encrypted by the secret key they encapsulate. _Secret_
network keys _should never_ be distributed.

## 3. Background & Motivation

In a decentralized network of peers offering some service, any entity
wishing to make use of their services needs to be able to discover,
connect, and authenticate with the peers in a secure manner.

In this RFC we present an approach to secret storage [1] that enables
authentication and capability handshakes [2] in networking protocols between
two peers wishing to authenticate and securely communicate with each other.
Network keys are represented as a packed binary format encrypted into a
secret storage protected by a shared secret key.

### 4.3 Shared Secret Key

The shared secret key _S_ [8] is a 16 byte value determined by _B_. It
does not have to be unique, but should be secure and easy to transmit or
delegate to interested parties.

_S_ is used to compute the ephemeral intermediate value _s_, which is a
_seed_ for computing a _Curve25519_ [6] domain key pair _K_. To compute _s_,
compute the 32 byte BLAKE2b [7] hash of _S_.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s%20%3D%20S%27%20%3D%20BLAKE2b_%7B256%7D%28S%29)

The value of _S_ is shared between _B_ and _A_. It is determined by _B_,
and given to _A_ through some form of delegation [5].

### 4.3 Domain Key Pair

The domain key pair _K_ is computed from the BLAKE2b hash of the ephemeral
intermediate value _s_ (_S'_) concatenated with 32 byte BLAKE2b hash of
_B<sub>secret</sub>_. The key pair is a _Curve25519_ [6] key pair.

Therefore:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K%20%3D%20Curve25519%28BLAKE2b_%7B256%7D%28S%27%7CB%27_%7Bsecret%7D%29%29%20%3D%20Curve25519%28BLAKE2b_%7B256%7D%28BLAKE2b_%7B256%7D%28S%29%7CBLAKE2b_%7B256%7D%28B_%7Bsecret%7D%29%29%29)

Where _K<sub>public</sub>_ (_K<sub>p</sub>_) is the 32 byte public key and
_K<sub>secret</sub>_ (_K<sub>s</sub>_) is the 32 byte secret key.

### 4.4 Discovery Key

The discovery key _D_ is a unique 32 byte value used for peer discovery in
networks. This value is a 32 byte BLAKE2b hash of _K<sub>secret</sub>_.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D%20%3D%20BLAKE2b_%7B256%7D%28K_%7Bsecret%7D%29)

### 4.5 Bob's Keys

Bob's keys are an asymmetrical _ed25519_ key pair _B_. They represent
the authenticity of Bob. Bob's public key, among others, is made public
and stored in the **public** _network keys_ secret storage. Alice can use
_B<sub>public</sub>_ to prove capability with Bob. Bob's secret key, along
with _K<sub>secret</sub>_ is stored in a **secret** _network keys_ secret
storage encrypted by _B<sub>secret</sub>_.

### 4.6 Alice's Keys

Alice's keys are an asymmetrical _ed25519_ key pair _A_. They represent
the authenticity of Alice. Alice can use her public key _A<sub>public</sub>_
and secret key _A<sub>secret</sub>_ with _K<sub>public</sub>_ and
_B<sub>public</sub>_ to prove _capability_ and _authenticate_ with Bob.
Alice acquires _B<sub>public</sub>_ and _K<sub>public</sub>_ from Bob's
**public** _network keys_.

### 4.7 Binary Format

This section outlines the packed binary format for network keys.

#### 4.7.1 Magic Bytes

A magic byte is appended to the packed binary first to indicate the type of
keys that will follow.

_PKX_, or _T<sub>public</sub>_, is a single byte represented by the
hexadecimal value `0x70` to indicate that the keys in the secret storage
are public keys. `0x70`, or `112`, is the Unicode code point value for
the ASCII character `p`.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_%7Bpublic%7D%20%3D%20PKX%20%3A%3D%2070_%7Bhex%7D)

_SKX_, or _T<sub>secret</sub>_, is a single byte represented by the
hexadecimal value `0x73` to indicate that the keys in the secret storage
are secret keys. `0x73`, or `115`, is the Unicode code point value for
the ASCII character `s`.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_%7Bsecret%7D%20%3D%20SKX%20%3A%3D%2073_%7Bhex%7D)

#### 4.7.2 Version

The binary format version, an _unsigned integer_ (_[0x00, 0xff]_), is
appended directly after the _magic byte_. It should be considered when
unpacking to determine the layout of the binary body after the header.

This RFC outlines a binary format for version _**0x00**_.

#### 4.7.3 Layout

The network keys are stored as a packed binary represented by a header
and a body.

```
> HEADER ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ > BODY ~~~~~~~~~~
| 1 byte  | 1 byte      | 32 bytes          | 32 bytes        | 32 bytes       |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| PKX|SKX | Version (V) | Discovery Key (D) | Public Key (B)  | Domain Key (K) |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
```

##### 4.7.3.1 Header

The header length of the network keys binary is always
`1 + 1 + 32 + 32 = 66` bytes. It contains a magic byte, version, discovery
key _D_, and public key _B_ generated by Bob. The magic byte indicates the
type of the keys that follow right after the header.

##### 4.7.3.2 Body

The body of the network keys is a series of one or more public or secret
keys.

#### 4.7.4 Packing

Packing network keys into a binary buffer should follow the steps outlined
in this section.

Packing is described by the function _pack(T, V, D, Bp, K)_ that "packs",
or concatenates _T_, _V_, _D_, _Bp_, and _Kp_ or _Ks_ into a compact
binary buffer.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?pack%28T%2C%20V%2C%20D%2C%20B%2C%20K%29%20%3D%20T%20%7CV%7CD%7CB_%7Bpublic%7D%7CK)

Where

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K%28T%29%20%3D%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%20K_%7Bsecret%7D%20%26%20%5Ctext%7B%20if%20%7D%20T%3D%2073_%7Bhex%7D%5C%5C%20K_%7Bpublic%7D%20%26%20%5Ctext%7B%20otherwise%20%7D%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D)

#### 4.7.5 Unpacking

Unpacking network keys from a binary buffer should follow the steps outlined
in this section.

Unpacking network keys is described by the function _unpack(Z)_ that
"unpacks" public and/or secret network keys from a binary buffer. Unpacking
will always reveal _T_, _V_, _D_, and _Bp_. If the packed buffer
contains both public and secret network keys, then both _Kp_ and _Ks_
can be derived, otherwise _Kp_ or _Ks_ depending on _T_.

The following procedure outlines the unpacking of public and secret
network keys:

1. Read the first byte _MB_ as _T_ to determine the type of the packed binary
2. Read the second byte _V_ as the packed binary format version
3. Read the 32 byte discovery key _D_ at offset `1 + 1` to `1 + 1 + 32`
4. Read the 32 byte public key _Bp_ at offset `1 + 1 + 32` to `1 + 1 + 32 + 32`
5. If _MB = T<sub>public</sub>_, read the public 32 byte domain key
   _Kp_ at offset `1 + 1 + 32 + 32` to `1 + 1 + 32 + 32 + 32`,
   otherwise, read the 32 byte secret domain key _Ks_ at offset `1 + 1 +
   32 + 32` to `1 + 1 + 32 + 32 + 32`

### 4.8 Key Generation

Bob's asymmetric network keys can be generated from _B_ and _S_ by
following the procedure outlined in this section.

1. Compute _ephemeral_ _BLAKE2b_ shared secret key _s_ from the _constant_
   shared secret key _S_
2. Compute _constant_ _Curve25519_ domain key pair _K_ based on the 32 byte
   BLAKE2b hash of the previously computed _ephemeral_ _s_ seed value
   concatenated with the 32 byte BLAKE2b hash of _constant B<sub>secret</sub>_
3. Compute _constant_ _BLAKE2b_ discovery key _D_ from
   _constant_ secret key _K<sub>secret</sub>_
4. Pack _PKX_, _V_, _D_, _B<sub>public</sub>_, and _K<sub>public</sub>_ into
   _Z<sub>public</sub>_
5. Pack _SKX_, _V_, _D_, _B<sub>public</sub>_, and _K<sub>secret</sub>_ into
   _Z<sub>secret</sub>_
6. Concatenate and return _Z<sub>public</sub>_ and _Z<sub>secret</sub>_
   where _Z_ is a packed binary buffer containing _both_ public and
   secret network keys

_KeyGen<sub>V</sub>(B, S)_ describes a function  where _V_ is the binary format
version, _B_ is Bob's key pair, and _S_ is the _shared secret key_
used as input for the generation and packing of public and secret network keys.

### 4.9 Secret Storage

This RFC outlines a secret storage [1] scheme for _public_ and _secret_
network keys based on a _constant shared secret **S**_ and a _constant
secret key **Bs**_. _Public network keys_ are encrypted into a secret
storage using a shared secret key _S_. The secret storage is valid
_JSON_ and suitable for transmission or on-disk persistence. _Secret
network keys_ are encrypted into secret storage using a key derived from
_S_ and _Bs_ (_S' · B<sub>secret</sub>_).

#### 4.9.1 Public Keys

##### 4.9.1.1 Encryption

To encrypt _Z<sub>public</sub>_ of _Z_ into secret storage using _S_:

1. Compute _S' = s = BLAKE2b<sub>256</sub>(S)_
2. Compute random 16 byte initialization vector _IV_
3. Compute encryption key _k_ from 16 byte BLAKE2b hash of _S'_
4. Encrypt _Z<sub>public</sub>_ of _Z_ into secret storage using
   encryption key _k_ and initialization vector _IV_

##### 4.9.1.2 Decryption

To decrypt _Z<sub>public</sub>_ of _Z_ out of secret storage using _S_:

1. Compute _S' = s = BLAKE2b<sub>256</sub>(S)_
2. Compute encryption key _k_ from 16 byte BLAKE2b hash of _S'_
3. Decrypt _Z<sub>public</sub>_ of _Z_ from public storage using
   encryption key _k_

#### 4.9.2 Secret Keys

##### 4.9.2.1 Encryption

To encrypt _Z<sub>secret</sub>_ of _Z_ into secret storage using _S_:

1. Compute _S' = s = BLAKE2b<sub>256</sub>(S)_
2. Compute random 16 byte initialization vector _IV_
3. Compute encryption key _k_ from 16 byte BLAKE2b hash of _S' · B<sub>secret</sub>_
4. Encrypt _Z<sub>secret</sub>_ of _Z_ into secret storage using
   encryption key _k_ and initialization vector _IV_

##### 4.9.2.2 Decryption

To decrypt _Z<sub>secret</sub>_ of _Z_ out of secret storage using _S_:

1. Compute _S' = s = BLAKE2b<sub>256</sub>(S)_
2. Compute encryption key _k_ from 16 byte BLAKE2b hash of _S' · B<sub>secret</sub>_
3. Decrypt _Z<sub>secret</sub>_ of _Z_ from secret storage using
   encryption key _k_

### 4.10 Delegation

_Network key delegation_ [5] involves the direct or indirect distribution
of _public network keys_ to untrusted parties. Consider public network
keys generated by Bob that are delegated to Alice. Bob makes his network
keys available through a trusted means of communication. Bob intends for
his keys to be delegated this way and therefore Bob _trusts_
communication with Alice because she acquired Bob's keys through
his _intended delegation_. The acquisition of Bob's network keys through
delegation gave _capability_ to Alice. Alice's key pair and Bob's _shared
secret key_ allow Alice to _authenticate_ with Bob, and consequently,
open a secure channel for communication. Secure and intended delegation of
network keys occurs over a trusted channel, or _trusted path_.

#### 4.10.1 Trusted Paths

A _trusted path_ [12] provides confidence to a user that they are
actually communicating over a channel with what they intended to
communicate with. Trusted paths allow users to trust the path of
communication such that no attacker can intercept, modify, or block
messages communicated.

Alice acquires Bob's public network keys through _trusted paths_
that Bob can directly or indirectly delegate his network keys.
The electronic exchange of secure messages (e.g. e-mail) can be a
_trusted path_. A _physical trusted path_ through in-person-to-person
communication can enable the secure exchange of physical digital storage
that stores Bob's network keys.

## 5. Real World Example

The following sections detail real world JavaScript code for
generating, packing, and unpacking network keys.

### 5.1 Generate(Bp, Bs, S)

```js
function generate0(Bp, Bs, S) {
  // ephemeral B secret key
  const bs = blake2b(Bs, 32)
  // constant shared secret
  const s = blake2b(S, 32)
  // compute K seed
  const seed = blake2b(concat([s, bs]), 32)
  // constant domain key pair from blake2b(s . bs)
  const K = curve25519.keyPair(seed)
  // constant discovery key from Kp
  const D = blake2b(K.publicKey, 32)
  // pack Z = Zp | Zs
  const Z = concat([
    pack0(SKX, D, Bp, K.publicKey),
    pack0(SKX, D, Bp, K.secretKey)
  ])
  return Z
}
```

### 5.2 Pack(T, D, Bp, K)

```js
function pack0(T, D, Bp, K) {
  return concat([T, 0x0, D, Bp, K])
}
```

### 5.3 Unpack(Z)

```js
function unpack0(Z) {
  const T = Z[0]
  const V = Z[1]
  const D = Z.slice(2, 2 + 32)
  const B = Z.slice(2 + 32, 2 + 32 + 32)
  const K = Z.slice(2 + 32 + 32, 2 + 32 + 32 + 32)
  return {
    discoveryKey: D,
    publicKey: B,
    domain: 0x73 == T
      ? { secretKey: K }
      : { publicKey: K }
  }
}
```

## 6. Drawbacks

* _Delegation_ requires **work** and proactive thought about the
distribution of network keys. This pattern requires trusted paths that
both _Alice_ and _Bob_ **trust**. Network keys could be distributed on
key servers, or available through the Internet, downloadable through a web
browser. This may not be secure.

* This RFC makes use of a JSON-based secret storage [1]. For **some**
  environments, a JSON-based secret storage may not be suitable for
  transmission and storage

## 7. Alternatives

## 9. Unresolved Questions

N/A

## 10 Security Considerations

* Never use common words for _shared secret keys_. Consider using a
  password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) [13] that reveals a key
  suitable for encryption (not human memory)
