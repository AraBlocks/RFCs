## 0. Abstract

**ARA Filesystem Contract Standard** defines a common abstract contract inherited by AFS smart contracts. This standard allows AFSs to be treated atomically in an object-oriented way on the blockchain by deploying a smart contract instance for each AFS.

## 1. Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

**ARA Filesystem Contract Standard** enables AFSs to have a defined, structured, and self-contained presence on the blockchain. This standard provides basic AFS blockchain interactions such as price-setting, random-access-contract storage, and purchasing.

## 3. Background & Motivation

A standard abstract contract allows any AFS to be used everywhere on ARA, provides greater clarity into how AFSs are represented on the blockchain, and enhances ownership tracking. Furthermore, because we expect ARA tokens to be used for payments, unique contracts for each AFS facilitate more discrete [approvals](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#approve), and thus, greater security.

## 4. AFS Contract Standard

This section outlines the functions and global variables included in the AFS abstract contract.

### 4.1 Terminology

The rest of the sections that follow make use of abbreviated forms of the
following terminology outlined in this section.

* _**DID**_ - Decentralized Identifier, the ARA identity of this AFS [1]

### 4.2 AFS Abstract Contract

``` solidity
contract AFSBase {
  address public owner_;
  address public token_;
  address public lib_;

  string  public did_;
  bool    public listed_;
  uint256 public price_;
  uint256 public reward_;

  event Commit(string _did, uint8 _file, uint256 _offset, bytes _buffer);
  event Unlisted(string _did);
  event PriceSet(string _did, uint256 _price);
  event RewardSet(string _did, uint256 _reward);
  event Purchased(string _purchaser, string _did);

  modifier onlyBy(address _account)
  {
      require(
          msg.sender == _account,
          "Sender not authorized."
      );
      _;
  }

  // Storage (random-access-contract)
  mapping(uint8 => Buffers) metadata_;
  struct Buffers {
    mapping (uint256 => bytes) buffers;
    uint256[] offsets;
    bool invalid;
  }

  // Storage methods (random-access-contract)
  function write(uint8 _file, uint256 _offset, bytes _buffer, bool _last_write) external returns (bool success);
  function read(uint8 _file, uint256 _offset) public view returns (bytes buffer);
  function unlist() public returns (bool success);

  // Pricing methods
  function setPrice(uint256 _price) external returns (bool success);
  function setReward(uint256 _reward) external returns (bool success);

  // Purchase methods
  function purchase(string _purchaser) external returns (bool success);
}
```

### 4.3 Global Variables

#### owner

The owner of this AFS. This is the only address that can modify the storage of this AFS contract.

``` solidity
address public owner_
```

#### token

The ARAToken contract address.

``` solidity
address public token_
```

### lib

The ARA Library contract address.

``` solidity
address public lib_
```

#### did

The ARA DID of this AFS generated when the AFS was created.

``` solidity
string public did_
```

#### listed

Boolean flag indicating whether this AFS can be purchased.

``` solidity
bool public listed_
```

#### price

The total price (in ARA tokens) of this AFS, including rewards.

``` solidity
uint256 public price_
```

#### reward

The reward allocation for this AFS. Cannot exceed `price_`

``` solidity
uint256 public reward_
```


#### metadata

The AFS SLEEP files `metadata.tree` and `metadata.signatures`. `0` maps to the `tree` file and `1` maps the `signatures` file.

``` solidity
mapping(uint8 => Buffers) metadata_
```

### 4.4 Structs

#### Buffers

Represents either the `tree` or `signatures` file

``` solidity
struct Buffers {
    mapping (uint256 => bytes) buffers;
    uint256[] offsets;
    bool invalid;
  }
```

##### buffers

Maps buffer offsets to entries in the `tree` or `signatures` file

``` solidity
mapping (uint256 => bytes) buffers
```

##### offsets

An array of all the offsets in the `buffers` mapping for the `tree` or `signatures` file

``` solidity
uint256[] offsets
```

##### invalid

Flag representing the validity of this SLEEP file

``` solidity
bool invalid;
```

### 4.5 Methods

#### write

Writes `_buffer` at `_offset` in `_file`. If `_last_write` is true, emits the `Commit` event. If `_file` has been marked `invalid`, this function reverts. Only `owner_` may call this function.

``` solidity
function write(uint8 _file, uint256 _offset, bytes _buffer, bool _last_write) external returns (bool success)
```

#### read

Returns the `buffer` located at `_offset` in `_file` if it exists. Otherwise, returns an empty buffer.

``` solidity
function read(uint8 _file, uint256 _offset) public view returns (bytes buffer)
```

#### unlist

Invalidates the SLEEP files for this AFS by setting both `Buffer` structs to `invalid`. `listed()` should always return `false` after this function is called. Only `owner_` may call this function.

``` solidity
function unlist() public returns (bool success)
```

#### setPrice

Sets the price (in ARA tokens) of this AFS, including rewards. Only the `owner_` may call this function. This function should revert if `reward` has been set and `_price` does not exceed it.

``` solidity
function setPrice(uint256 _price) external returns (bool success)
```

#### setReward

Sets the reward allocation (in ARA tokens) for this AFS. Only the `owner` may call this function. This function should revert if `price` has been set and `_reward` exceeds it.

``` solidity
function setReward(uint256 _reward) external returns (bool success)
```

#### purchase

Transfers #`price` ARA tokens from `_purchaser`'s wallet and adds this `did` to `_purchaser`'s library in the _Library_ contract. Requires `_purchaser` to first [`approve`](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#approve) this AFS contract address in the _ARA Token_ contract.

``` solidity
function purchase(string _purchaser) external returns (bool success)
```

### 4.6 Events

#### Commit

MUST trigger when the final buffer has been written in a commit

``` solidity
event Commit(string _did, uint8 _file, uint256 _offset, bytes _buffer)
```

#### Unlisted

MUST trigger when an AFS is unlisted

``` solidity
event Unlisted(string _did)
```

#### PriceSet

MUST trigger when an AFS price is set

``` solidity
event PriceSet(string _did, uint256 _price)
```

#### RewardSet

MUST trigger when an AFS reward is set

``` solidity
event RewardSet(string _did, uint256 _reward)
```

#### Purchased

MUST trigger when an AFS is purchased

``` solidity
event Purchased(string _purchaser, string _did)
```

## 5. Real World Example

The following is a real world example of what a deployed AFS contract might look like with method implementations.

``` solidity
contract AFS is AFSBase {

  constructor(address _lib, address _token, string _did) public {
    owner_  = msg.sender;
    token_  = _token;
    lib_    = _lib;
    did_    = _did;
    listed_ = true;
    price_  = 0;
    reward_ = 0;
  }

  // Storage methods (random-access-contract)
  function write(uint8 _file, uint256 _offset, bytes _buffer, bool _last_write) external onlyBy(owner_) returns (bool success){
    // make sure AFS hasn't been removed
    require(!metadata_[_file].invalid);

    metadata_[_file].buffers[_offset] = _buffer;
    metadata_[_file].offsets.push(_offset);

    if (_last_write) {
      emit Commit(did_, _file, _offset, _buffer);
    }
    return true;
  }

  function read(uint8 _file, uint256 _offset) public view returns (bytes buffer) {
    if (metadata_[_file].invalid) {
      return ""; // empty bytes
    }
    return metadata_[_file].buffers[_offset];
  }

  function unlist() public onlyBy(owner_) returns (bool success) {
    metadata_[0].invalid = true;
    metadata_[1].invalid = true;
    listed_ = false;
    emit Unlisted(did_);
    return true;
  }

  // Pricing methods
  function setPrice(uint256 _price) external onlyBy(owner_) returns (bool success) {
    require(reward_ <= _price);
    price_ = _price;
    emit PriceSet(did_, price_);
    return true;
  }

  function setReward(uint256 _reward) external onlyBy(owner_) returns (bool success) {
    require(_reward <= price_);
    reward_ = _reward;
    emit RewardSet(did_, reward_);
    return true;
  }

  // Purchase methods
  function purchase(string _purchaser) external returns (bool success) {
    ARAToken token = ARAToken(token_);
    require (token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= price_); // check if purchaser approved purchase

    if (token.transferFrom(address(this), owner_, price_ - reward_)) {
      Library lib = Library(lib_);
      lib.addLibraryItem(_purchaser, did_);
      emit Purchased(_purchaser, did_);
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Drawbacks

N/A

## 7. Alternatives

* Create functional smart contracts with mappings for each AFS (i.e., separate contracts for `Storage`, `Price`, `Purchase`, `Rewards`)

## 8. Adoption Strategy

This AFS Contract Standard should be built into the AFS `commit` function, wherein the first ever `commit` for an AFS should deploy a smart contract for that AFS. All relevant AFS and DCDN functions, such as `destroy`, `price`, `rewards`, and `purchase` should seek to interface with this contract.
