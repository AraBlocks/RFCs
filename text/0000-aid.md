## 0. Abstract
The ARA Identity is the identity management module implemented on the ARA network. It conforms to W3C Credentials Communtiy Group DID specification [1].

## 1.Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction
AID is an identifier which is used to identify an entity in the ARA network. It is based on the DID specification defined by w3c-ccg. Each entity in the ARA network is identified by its AID. Each AID points to a DID Document which contains a set of service endpoints which can be used to interact with the entity. The main principle employed in ARA Identity is the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) which eliminates the need for neither a centralized authority nor a single point of failure.

## 3. Background & Motivation

## 4. ARA Identity
ARA Identity is the identity management module for creating & managing identities in the ARA network.

### 4.1 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

#### Sample Identifiers : -

#### DID
``
did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae
``

#### DID Document
```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae",

  }],

  }]
}
```

### 4.2 Ethereum

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality. ARA Identity leverages the smart contract functionality to create identities on the blockchain. This allows identity management to be implemented on ARA network without a central authority or a single point of failure

This module uses ``web3.js``, a Javascript API to create accounts on the Ethereum blockchain

#### 4.2.1 Ethereum Account

ARA Identity uses the Ethereum's DLT to store all information associated with each identity in the ARA network

##### 1. create

Ethereum accounts are created by leveraging the ``web3.eth.accounts.create`` method. It can take an optional entropy value which can defined in the web3 context object

```js
const account = await ethereum.account.create({web3})
```
-- where web3 is the web3 API context

##### 2. load

TODO

#### 4.2.2 Ethereum Entropy
The Ethereum create method takes an optional random string value as an entropy value. This can used to increase the entropy of the ``create`` method.

##### ARA Ethereum Entropy Constants
```js
const kDefaultEntropySize = 32
const kMinEntropySize = 16
```


#### Ethereum Wallet
ARA Identity creates an Ethereum wallet by using the web3 account object returned from the above method

##### 1. load
```js
const wallet = await ethereum.wallet.load({account})
```

### 4.3 Identity Management Methods
ARA Identity provides different methods to manage user identity on the ARA network.

#### 4.3.1 create
To create a new ARA identity, the ``create`` method of the ARA Identity can be invoked. This method creates an encoded identity keystore which is secured by a passphrase

```js
const identity = await aid.create({ context, password })
```

where ``context`` is the web3 API context and ``password`` is the passphrase obtained from the user

#### 4.3.2 archive
Archiving an identity is the process of broadcasting newly created identities so that they can be resolved & discovered by other services & endpoints

ARA Network comprises of individual nodes known as ``Archivers`` who act as identity archivers listening to new identities being created in the network

The ``archive`` method takes the ARA ID and a shared network key on which an archiver node is listening to

```sh
foo@bar:~$ aid archive did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae -k archiver
```
##### Note:-
An ARA ID needs to be archived first before other services can discover/resolve them in the ARA network

#### 4.3.3 resolve
Resolving an identity is the process of proving the proof of ownership of an ARA identity and obtaining the DDO document associated with an ID.

The ARA network has special network nodes which act as an Identity resolver(similar to a DNS lookup). These resolvers provide a REST API through which services can send GET requests and obtain the DDO document of an associated ARA ID

The ``resolve`` method takes the ARA ID and a shared network key on which an resolver node is listening to

##### Method - 1
```sh
foo@bar:~$ aid resolve did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae -k resolver
```

##### Method - 2
```sh
curl -X GET https://araresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae?key='resolver'
```
