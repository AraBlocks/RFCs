## 0. Abstract
ARA Identity is the identity management module implemented on the ARA network. It conforms to W3C Credentials Communtiy Group DID specification [1]. It is implemented in Node.js[2] and provides a command line interface. This RFC describes about the module interface on ARA Identity

## 1.Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction
ARA Identity is an identifier which is used to identify an entity in the ARA network. It is based on the DID specification defined by w3c-ccg. Each entity in the ARA network is identified by its AID. Each AID points to a DID Document which contains a set of service endpoints which can be used to interact with the entity. The main principle employed in ARA Identity is the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) which eliminates the need for neither a centralized authority nor a single point of failure.

## 3. Background & Motivation
Every entity in a network should be uniquely identifiable and discoverable to other entities and services in the same network. Traditional identity management has certain drawbacks due to having a centralized authority which makes it vulnerable to single point of failure & data breaches. ARA Identity implements a distributed identity management based on W3C Credentials Communtiy Group DID specification [1]. This document describes how to create & manage identities in the ARA network

## 4. ARA Identity

### 4.1 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Specification


#### Sample DID
``
did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae
``

#### Sample DID Document
```js
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae",
  "publicKey": [{
    "id": "did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae#keys-1",

  }]
}
```

### 4.2 Ethereum

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality. ARA Identity leverages the smart contract functionality to create identities on the blockchain. This allows identity management to be implemented on ARA network without a central authority or a single point of failure

This module uses ``web3.js``, a Javascript API to create accounts on the Ethereum blockchain

#### 4.2.1 Ethereum Account

ARA Identity uses the Ethereum's DLT to store all information associated with each identity in the ARA network

#### `create()`

Ethereum accounts are created by leveraging the `web3.eth.accounts.create` method. It can take an optional entropy value which can defined in the web3 context object

```js
const account = await ethereum.account.create({web3})
```
where web3 is the web3 API context

#### `load()`

TODO

#### 4.2.2 Ethereum Entropy
The Ethereum create method takes an optional random string as an entropy value. This can used to increase the entropy of the `create` method.

##### ARA Ethereum Entropy Constants
```js
const kDefaultEntropySize = 32
const kMinEntropySize = 16
```

#### 4.2.3 Ethereum Wallet
ARA Identity creates an Ethereum wallet by using the web3 account object returned from the `create()` method

#### `load()`
```js
const wallet = await ethereum.wallet.load({account})
```

### 4.3 Module Interface
ARA Identity provides different methods to manage user identity on the ARA network.

#### 4.3.1 `aid.create()`
To create a new ARA identity, the `create` method of the ARA Identity can be invoked. This method creates an encoded identity keystore which is secured by a passphrase

```js
const identity = await aid.create({ context, password })
```

where `context` is the web3 API context and `password` is the passphrase obtained from the user

#### 4.3.2 `aid.archive()`
Archiving an identity is the process of broadcasting newly created identities so that they can be resolved & discovered by other services & endpoints. ARA Network comprises of individual nodes known as `Archivers` who act as identity archivers listening to new identities being created in the network

To archive an identity, use the `archive` method and pass in the newly created identity along with the shared network key of the `archiver` node

```
aid.archive("did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae", opts)
```
##### Note:-
An ARA ID needs to be archived first before other services can discover/resolve them in the ARA network

#### 4.3.3 `aid.resolve()`
The ARA network has special network nodes which act as an Identity resolver(similar to a DNS lookup). These resolvers provide a method interface and a REST API through which services can send requests and obtain the DDO document associated with an ARA ID

To resolve an identity, use the `resolve` method or the resolver API as below.

#### Method - 1
```
aid.resolve("did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae", opts)
```

#### Method - 2
```sh
curl -X GET https://araresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:ara:9edeac1e44098ad940c8155baf563c1200fe35df331e74daaac8c2712e431cae?key='resolver'
```

## 5. Real World Example

A simple client application can implement identity management on the ARA network by leveraging `ARA Identity` module

```js
const aid = require('ara-identity')
const context = require('ara-context')() // web3 context object

// creating an identity
// opts.context - web3 context object for Ethereum
// opts.password - passphrase for keystore encryption
const id = await aid.create({context,"password":'hello'})

// archiving an identity to make it discoverable
await aid.archive(id, opts)

// resolving an identity to retrive DDO object
const ddoObject = await aid.resolve(id, opts)

```

## 6. Drawbacks

TODO

## 7. Alternatives

None at the moment (in the ARA Network)

## 8. Adoption Strategy

The client application should conform to the interface methods specified in this document to be able create & manage identities in the ARA network

## 9. Unresolved Questions

This module is currently limited to Node.js and excludes other programming languages (TBD)
